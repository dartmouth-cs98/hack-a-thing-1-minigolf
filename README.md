We attempted to create an AR mini golf game. Sandy did the golf club mechanics and Brian did the gaze and hololens environment set up. 
We learned that setting up the hololens environment on a pc was difficult and that we do not want to continue to develop for the hololens.
We learned Unity and found the creative possibilities very intriguing. 
The gesture to move the club did not work.
